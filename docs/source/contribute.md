# Contribute

+++

Our framework is from the community to the community of multi-objective optimization. We would be more than glad if some collaborations and contributions were to happen soon. 

Some topics that are, in our opinion, interesting to incorporate in the future:

+++

- **New features:** For instance, new test problems, algorithms, or any other multi-objective related implementation.

- **Constraint Handling:** So far, mostly parameter-less constraint handling is used. Many different strategies of handling constraints have been studied, and some state of the art methods should be provided in *pymoo* as well.

- **Interactive Visualization:** Our framework provides static visualization for the objective space in higher dimensions. However, it would be nice to make it possible to explore solutions interactively. A suitable choice would be a web-based application with a javascript/typescript based interface using *pymoo* to answer requests necessary for plotting or optimization

- **Other Topics:** Those are topics that came to our mind. However, there are many more things related to multi-objective optimization that are interesting and standard implementation in a framework would be useful!

+++

If you are interested in any of those topics, please let us know.
