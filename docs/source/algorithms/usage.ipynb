    "As you might be used to executing algorithms from other frameworks, pymoo offers a functional interface. It requires to pass the problem to be solved, the algorithm to be used, and optionally (but for most algorithms recommend) a termination condition. Other important arguments are discussed in the [Interface](../interface/index.ipynb) tutorial. For executing custom code in between iterations the [Callback](../interface/callback.ipynb) object can be useful. Moreover, it is worth noting that the algorithm object is cloned before being modified. Thus, two calls with the same algorithm object and random seed lead to the same result."

The reason to use one or the other interface is to have more control during an algorithm execution or even modify the algorithm object while injecting new solutions."

Instead of calling one function, two function calls are executed. First, `algorithm.ask()` returns a solution set to be evaluated, and second, `algorithm.tell(solutions)` receives the evaluated solutions to proceed to the next generation.
