.. admonition:: Overview
    :class: myOwnStyle

    - `Interface <../interface/index.ipynb>`_: An overview over the most important parameters of the interface.
    - `Problems <../problems/index.ipynb>`_: A guide how to implement your own custom problem and how to use test problems already being implemented.
    - `Algorithms <../algorithms/index.ipynb>`_: Information about all algorithms and how to use them for optimization.
    - `Operators <../operators/index.ipynb>`_: An overview of evolutionary operators.
    - `Customization <../customization/index.ipynb>`_: How to design your custom evolutionary operators to develop an efficient genetic algorithm for your specific optimization problem.
    - `Visualization <../visualization/index.ipynb>`_: Different techniques for visualization the results of an optimization run or a single solution.
    - `Multi-Criteria Decision Making <../mcdm/index.ipynb>`_: How to select a solution from a solution set.
    - `FAQ <../faq.ipynb>`_: Frequently asked questions.
```

We hope you have enjoyed the getting started guide. We refer to each section covered on the [landing page](https://pymoo.org). If you have any questions or concerns, do not hesitate to [contact us](../contact.rst).
