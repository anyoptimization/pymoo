abstract="In this paper, we present a parallel version of a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm that incorporates some coevolutionary concepts. Such an algorithm was previosly developed by the authors. Two approaches were adopted to parallelize our algorithm (both of them based on a master-slave scheme): one uses Pthreads (shared memory) and the other one uses MPI (distributed memory). We conduct a small comparative study to analyze the impact that the parallelization has on performance. Our results indicate that both parallel versions produce important improvements in the execution times of the algorithm (with respect to the serial version) while keeping the quality of the results obtained.",

  abstract = {When solving constrained multiobjective optimization problems, an important issue is how to balance convergence, diversity, and feasibility simultaneously. To address this issue, this paper proposes a parameter-free constraint handling technique, a two-archive evolutionary algorithm, for constrained multiobjective optimization. It maintains two collaborative archives simultaneously: one, denoted as the convergence-oriented archive (CA), is the driving force to push the population toward the Pareto front; the other one, denoted as the diversity-oriented archive (DA), mainly tends to maintain the population diversity. In particular, to complement the behavior of the CA and provide as much diversified information as possible, the DA aims at exploring areas under-exploited by the CA including the infeasible regions. To leverage the complementary effects of both archives, we develop a restricted mating selection mechanism that adaptively chooses appropriate mating parents from them according to their evolution status. Comprehensive experiments on a series of benchmark problems and a real-world case study fully demonstrate the competitiveness of our proposed algorithm, in comparison to five state-of-the-art constrained evolutionary multiobjective optimizers.},

  abstract = {For solving constrained multiobjective optimization problems (CMOPs), many algorithms have been proposed in the evolutionary computation research community for the past two decades. Generally, the effectiveness of an algorithm for CMOPs is evaluated by artificial test problems. However, after a brief review of current artificial test problems, we have found that they are not well-designed and fail to reflect the characteristics of real-world applications (e.g., small feasibility ratio). Thus, in this paper, we first propose a new constraint construction method to facilitate the systematic design of test problems. Then, on the basis of this method, we design a new test suite consisting of 14 instances, which covers diverse characteristics extracted from real-world CMOPs and can be divided into four types. Considering that the comprehensive performance comparisons among the constraint-handling techniques (CHTs) remain scarce, we choose several representative CHTs and compare their performance on our test suite. The performance comparisons identify the strengths and weaknesses of different CHTs on different types of CMOPs and provide guidelines on how to select/design a CHT in a specific scenario.},

abstract = "Due to the vagaries of optimization problems encountered in practice, users resort to different algorithms for solving different optimization problems. In this paper, we suggest and evaluate an optimization procedure which specializes in solving a wide variety of optimization problems. The proposed algorithm is designed as a generic multi-objective, multi-optima optimizer. Care has been taken while designing the algorithm such that it automatically degenerates to efficient algorithms for solving other simpler optimization problems, such as single-objective uni-optimal problems, single-objective multi-optima problems and multi-objective uni-optimal problems. The efficacy of the proposed algorithm in solving various problems is demonstrated on a number of test problems chosen from the literature. Because of its efficiency in handling different types of problems with equal ease, this algorithm should find increasing use in real-world optimization problems."
