    "The functional interface of *pymoo* is based on a method called `minimize`, which abstracts any kind of optimization procedure in the framework. Each component of the functional interface is described in detail in the following. The guide starts with the `minimize` function itself, continues with the required and optional parameters, and ends with the `Result` object. "

    "Please note that besides the **functional** interface, *pymoo* also has an **object-oriented** interface (more information [here](../algorithms/index.ipynb)) for running an optimization algorithm. Both have their upsides and downsides, and one can be more convenient to use than another in specific situations. The functional interface allows optimization just in a few lines; the object-oriented interface allows quickly to alter an existing algorithm's behavior."
