    "#### 0.5.0\n",
    "\n",
    "- New Theme: As you might have noticed, *pymoo* got a new HTML theme, responsive, and has a better navigation bar.\n",
    "- New Project Structure: This includes some breaking changes. Now, the algorithms are grouped into different categories. For instance, `NSGA2` is now available at `pymoo.algorithms.moo.NSGA2`. \n",
    "- New Algorithms: RVEA, AGEMOEA, ES, SRES, ISRES\n",
    "- New Problem Implementation: The new version distinguishes between a `Problem` and an `ElementwiseProblem`. This has the advantage of handling the two different implementations on an object level.\n",
    "- New Interface: Most algorithms follow the `infill` and `advance` schema, which makes it very simple to write a for loop-based approach and customizing the algorithm's default behavior (for instance, a local search)\n",
    "- New Getting Started Guide consisting of five parts explaining better how *pymoo* can be used. The different alternatives of defining a problem and running an algorithm have been outsourced to the corresponding tutorial pages.\n"

    "- Improved Getting Started Guide with a new interface of providing functions instead of implementing the problem class\n",

    "- New Tutorial: An implementation of checkpoints to resume runs\n",
    "- New Test Problems Suites (Constrained): DAS-CMOP and MW (contributed by cyrilpic)\n",
    "- New Operators for Permutations: OrderCrossover and InversionMutation and usage to optimize routes for the TSP and Flowshop problem (contributed by Peng-YM )\n",
