    "\n",
    "- **Constraint Handling:** So far, mostly parameter-less constraint handling is used. Many different strategies of handling constraints have been studied, and some state of the art methods should be provided in *pymoo* as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Interactive Visualization:** Our framework provides static visualization for the objective space in higher dimensions. However, it would be nice to make it possible to explore solutions interactively. A suitable choice would be a web-based application with a javascript/typescript based interface using *pymoo* to answer requests necessary for plotting or optimization\n",

    "- **Other Topics:** Those are topics that came to our mind. However, there are many more things related to multi-objective optimization that are interesting and standard implementation in a framework would be useful!"
