    "Particle Swarm Optimization was proposed in 1995 by Kennedy and Eberhart <cite data-cite=\"pso\"></cite> based on the simulating of social behavior. The algorithm uses a *swarm* of particles to guide its search. Each particle has a velocity and is influenced by locally and globally best-found solutions. Many different implementations have been proposed in the past and, therefore, it is quite difficult to refer to THE correct implementation of PSO. However, the general concepts shall be explained in the following.\n",
