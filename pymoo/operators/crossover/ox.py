    The Ordered Crossover (OX) as explained in http://www.dmi.unict.it/mpavone/nc-cs/materiale/moscato89.pdf.

    Parameters
    ----------
    receiver : numpy.array
        The receiver of the sequence. The array needs to be repaired after the donation took place.
    donor : numpy.array
        The donor of the sequence.
    seq : tuple (optional)
        Tuple with two problems defining the start and the end of the sequence. Please note in our implementation
        the end of the sequence is included. The sequence is randomly chosen if not provided.

    shift : bool
        Whether during the repair the receiver should be shifted or not. Both version of it can be found in the
        literature.

    Returns
    -------

    y : numpy.array
        The offspring which was created by the ordered crossover.
